"""Modular (intra-/inter-community) edge-survival curves.

For a given removal order and a community partition, this module tracks
how the share of *intra*-community edges and *inter*-community edges in
the residual graph evolves over the attack.  Combined with the
residual-size curves from :mod:`network.robustness.metrics`, the modular
curves answer a second-order question: does an attack disproportionately
strip cross-community ties (decoupling sub-ecosystems) or intra-community
ties (eroding cohesion)?

Curves are normalised to their q = 0 baseline: ``intra[q] = intra_q /
intra_0`` and ``inter[q] = inter_q / inter_0``.  The ratio ``intra / inter``
is returned per step too; ``None`` whenever ``inter_q == 0`` (mathematically
undefined — emitting ``None`` keeps the resulting JSON payload free of
non-finite floats).

    """Intra/inter-community edge-survival curves along *removal_order*.

    *G* is the directed graph (never mutated).  *removal_order* is a list
    of node IDs to remove one at a time; nodes not (or no longer) present
    are silently skipped.  *partition* is a ``{node_id: community_id}``
    mapping; edges incident on a node missing from *partition* count as
    **inter** (an unassigned node has no community to match).

    Returns ``{"intra": [...], "inter": [...], "ratio": [...]}``, each of
    length ``len(removal_order) + 1``.  ``intra[q]`` / ``inter[q]`` are
    fractions of their q = 0 baseline; ``0.0`` when the baseline is itself
    zero (e.g. ``intra`` on a partition where no edge stays within a
    community).  ``ratio[q]`` is ``intra_q / inter_q``, or ``None`` when no
    inter-community edges remain.

    Update cost is O(degree) per removal: each removed node enumerates its
    own incident edges and reclassifies them — there is no full O(|E|)
    rescan per step.  Total cost is O(|E| + N).
